The revolution is here! Recently I've been getting out of my "Internet tech bubble" and opened
my eyes more to some awesome revolutions taking place in many other parts of the society.

The computer revolution has so far meant that information has been totally decentralized and free, where everyone can become a producer of digital content, with the cost and bar for entry getting ever lower. Now the same revolution is coming to physical production at "neck breaking" speed!!!

I remember the first time I watched a 3D printer and a drone last year. The type I saw looked like it had very limiting application and I didn't really envision the full potential. I thought it was limited to printing small prototype models of sticky/weak plastics. I didn't really think it could be used to create "real" consumer products. Boy was I wrong!

I've been deep diving into all the new technologies arriving on the scene and especially the promise of 3D printing already being demonstrated and I'm in total awe!

Finally the "means of production" will be in the hands of the people, and not the elite or the capitalists. All that is required is:

- your own 3D printer or access to one from your neighborhood
- basic materials (plastics, glass, metal, carbon fiber, ...)
- energy
- computer
- data file of 3D model

As the technology is advancing, it is possible to have a printer print clones of itself.
Enter the [RepRap printer](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/relativedesign/reprap-self-replicating-3d-printer-fuel-the-moveme)

This means that the price of a printer comes down to only material and energy costs. Which means an explosion of access to printers. Just think how quickly cellphones became a commodity everyone was using. It will likely be the same with 3D printers...

We also have the younger generation growing up with a much more access and community centric world view. You don't need to own anymore. Just have access when you need it, which makes perfect sense from both an economic, ecologic and convenience perspective. Why would you want to clutter your life with all this stuff. We are drowning in cheap consumer products already!

People are buying fancy designer goods to show off status, but what if anyone can design and print their own at almost no cost. Then the highest status will be your creativeness. Back to real human values, not the ability to prostitute/sell yourself for the highest price to an employer. Awesome!

Everyone has access to a computer. Printing software is also surely available for free. All software is becoming Open Source, and even Microsoft are throwing the towel and starting to offer much of their software for free. Data files of 3D models will also be shared in huge Open Source communities, using repos such as Github for sharing and collaborating on designs.

Manufacturing companies will soon be obsolete. Just like the music industry they will have to face that they won't be able to control their patents, and even then, people will just invent their own superior designs. Open source (crowd sourcing) is way more powerful than any corporate model!

The only real (potential) limits of this technology are:
- Government regulation
- Access to basic construction material
- Access to energy

However, the genie is already out of the bottle and no matter what/how they try, both corporations and governments will be helpless to try and stop or control this development. It is moving too fast... The legal process is extremely slow. People are inventive. Again just look at the digital revolution! The funny thing is that they can't even imagine that they will soon be obsolete.

The only real way they could potentially block this, would be to somehow limit access to building materials and energy, but I'm sure that we will soon be able to recycle all kinds of material.
I can easily imagine people going "dumpster diving" to find the materials they need for free, or trading various surplus material locally via online marketplaces.

You just need some way to turn whatever discarded product into powder which can be re-used to create something new from scratch. Wow, we would essentially mirror nature, where the particles of any dead organic material become parts of new living organisms... This is mind blowing!

When it comes to energy, the price of decentralised renewable energy solutions are becoming ever cheaper and accessible, and I see the young generation embracing the idea of being self-sufficient, also to lower utility costs.

Sure, we might not be able to print sophisticated digital equipment just yet, but most consumer products are pretty simple, such as clothes, furniture, kitchen utilities etc.

Combined with advances in robotics, AI, better software/applications, advances in automation, ...
the current system is quickly becoming outdated. Everything you know and take for granted are about to change radically.

It's only been 25 years since the first personal computers started to get traction and look where we are today. 3D printing is at a stage now where it is ready to impact the society at an even faster rate with mind blowing consequences...

I see most of the current business models going "out of business". Do you really need to travel or even go to work if you can "be there" in some virtual way, act through a robot stationed there etc? You no longer need the hugely ineffective globalised production/distribution model if it costs less to produce the good locally. For a few items, there might still be an economy of scale having a large factory, but perhaps that will go out of fashion. Why buy a mass-produces item when you can create your own unique one? If you have essentially free renewable energy and recycled material, is there even a real cost?

A potential problem with this distributed production model, would be even more "consumption", but I really think that it currently stems from status seeking behavior, and if we no longer have the need for companies and profits, he incentive for commercials will go away and people will consume less but be more creative and seek status by showing off their inventiveness instead!

Why would you need 50 pairs of shoes, if you can just put your shoe through the blender, fill it into your printer cartridge and print a new model when you need it? No more waste!?

It would be interesting if this would usher in a society where we try to be as efficient with material as nature... this should be the main job of government.

Other risk factors involve the potential of people to print their own weapons, drones etc. and thus makes it easy for revolutionary groups to apply force at a whole new level.
Police and government would no longer have the "monopoly of force" as anyone would be able to create rockets, machine riffles, bombs and drone delivery systems with computer aided targeting!?

It is hard to come to grips with all the potentials, good & bad of all this. Personally I imagine it will lead to a much more decentralized world, where the nation state model will collapse or be abandones. It will likley result in some kind of [Anarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy) in its truest sense, which actually means  a decentralized, super democratic kind of peoples government, the total opposite of the current "democratic" model, with centralized power in the hand of a few powerful/rich elites, beholden to huge banks and multinational corporations who have "enslaved" us all.

3D printing will enable the people to take back the power. We could end up with a society that benefits all and removes our dependence on the few who control access to key resources we need to survive... Hmm, a lot of speculation!

Of course it could also end up leading to wild chaos and civil unrest/war and throw us into the next Dark age, since the people in power are unlikely to let go of their system and power position without a fight.

So we need to move fast and work together in peace to make this a transition for good and not allow the corporate "minions" (ie. politicians, regulators, lawyers, mind controlling/brain washing media and police) to limit our access to these technologies.

This would finally allow us to break free from their stranglehold. The current system is killing the planet and producing a life of misery for most people. Time for a change, time for revolution. Technology could be the transformer and saviour of the planet, society and the common people, not be the slaver and controller as it has been used most of the time so far...

What do you think? How do you envision the impact of 3D printing and other decentralized, empowering technologies?
