| Before adding any code, we can roughly sketch out the layout of our application. In your text editor, create a new file and name it index.html. This file will contain the HTML templates of our completed application and trigger requests for the additional image, stylesheet, and JavaScript resources.
| To start, add the following text to 
strong index.html

pre
  code(class="javascript").
    Todos.Todo.FIXTURES = [
     {
       id: 1,
       title: 'Learn Ember.js',
       isCompleted: true
     },
     {
       id: 2,
       title: '...',
       isCompleted: false
     },
     {
       id: 3,
       title: 'Profit!',
       isCompleted: false
     }
    ];
