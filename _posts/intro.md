*Hello World!* About time I launch my own personal blog. In this fast moving world, it seems to be all 
about self promotion and marketing in order to get noticed and stand out from the crowd.
  
I also recently started [twitting](https://twitter.com/kmandrup) and updated my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=12361459).

Times and technologies are forever changing, ever more rapidly... Last year I was all into [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) having given up with 
ember as it was still pre 1.0 and undergoing massive changes, with documentation quickly outdated and difficult to get a grasp.

A year later, I have found *AngularJS* lacking in too many respects and not intuitive enough for my taste. 
Especially the famous *Directives API* feels like a "bastard child" to me. I never really grocked it with 
all the dials and watchers and digest cycles you have to configure...
  
As I was making a pit stop in Munich for a few weeks, I got in touch with an old friend [Sebastien Grosjean](gr.linkedin.com/in/sebastiengrosjean), 
CEO of [BookingSync](www.bookingsync.com) who I encountered when I started deep diving into Ember in 2013.
 
He convinced me to give Ember a second look and told me much had changed since we both got a bit frustrated trying to create views and helpers 
to wrap Bootstrap UI components. Since then Ember had its own [Component](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Component.html) abstraction and now came with an [Ember CLI](www.ember-cli.com) 
with an [addons API](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/06/24/introducing_ember_cli_addons.html) under development at that time.

I quickly looked into Components, CLI and Addons as I see the ability to divide an application into small, independent parts as critical for an 
application to scale as the complexity rises exponentially when the app grows. It turned out that the addons API was still undergoing finishing touches
 and was in need of documentation to reflect the latest API and act as a guide for how develop make your own.
  
The result of my efforts was embraced by the core team and other key developers and the result can be found [here]http://www.ember-cli.com/#developing-addons-and-blueprints)
  
In my next post I will dive deeper into how to develop custom Ember addons - what I learned from the front line so far...
