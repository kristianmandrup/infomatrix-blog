I'm playing around with [AppGyver](http://www.appgyver.com/) these days. I've managed to [integrate Firebase](http://infomatrix-blog.herokuapp.com/post/appgyver-and-firebase-2x) and configure  [Hybrid authentication](http://infomatrix-blog.herokuapp.com/post/hybrid-authentication-with-firebase-2x) using Firebase Simple login.

Now let's see how to get started with AppGyver so we can start integrating the Composer workflow, real time data layer and authentication...

First follow the [AppGyver getting started guide](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/getting_started) to setup you system with the infrastructure and developer environment required.

### KitchenSink

We will use the [KitchenSink](http://www.appgyver.com/supersonic/kitchensink) as the prototype/template to work on. First [fork the repo](https://github.com/AppGyver/supersonic-kitchensink/)

`git clone` your repo fork locally and open the project in an editor or IDE, such as [Atom](https://atom.io).

Install dependencies:

`npm i & bower install`

Update steroids CLI

`steroids update`

### Configuring a Simulator

If you haven't already configured an Android simulator, here is how for Mac OSX.
Should be a similar recipe on other platforms.

- [download Genymotion](https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/launchpad/download/)
- Unpack and install it in Applications
- open `~/.bash_profile`
- `export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/android-sdk-macosx`
- Start Genymotion
- Create a device called `steroids`

### Simulate on Device

Start the Steroids connector

`steroids connect`

This should build your app and start the connector with a browser UI.

From here you can start both an iOS and an Android simulator.

Browse around the app in either or both of the simulators to get a feel of what we can do.

### The app structure

The application is structured as follows:

- /app
- /config
- /dist
- bower.json
- Gruntfile.coffee
- package.json

We will start by looking at the `/dist` folder to get a feel for how a built application is packaged and what is contained therein.

### Distribution layout

The `/dist` folder contains the build. We can see it contains:

- /app
- /components
- /native-styles
- __appgyver_settings.xml
- config.android.xml
- config.ios.xml
- loading.html

The config files define general settings for each device environment.

`loading.html` is specific to iOS:

"If this file is present, it is shown automatically when a new steroids.views.WebView is pushed to the layer stack."

`__appgyver_settings.xml` is a json file which mirrors `structure.coffee` and defines which pages are preloaded. It also contains configuration for tabs, initial view and drawers etc.

The `/native-styles` folder contains `ios.css` and `android.css` which define CSS styles specific to the native UI components as defined by the Ionic fork, such as `navigation-bar`, `tab-bar` etc.

The `/components` folder contains the main libraries used:

- angular
- webcomponents (ie. Polymer)
- chartjs
- supersonic
- steroids-js

`supersonic` depends on `steroids-js` and `webcomponents` and build on those. The `steroids-js` library contains core supersonic infrastructure, such as Bridges, Events and so on...

Now let's look at the `/config` folder

### App Configuration

The configuration in `/config` consists of the following files:

- app.coffee
- cloud.json
- structure.coffee

### Structure config

Exports the following Hash objects

- tabs
- preloads
- drawers
- initialView

You should be able to add your own Structure configuration metadata and access them from within your app to declaratively define similar Application wide view parts or functionality aspects.
Let me know how ;)


### App config

Exports the following Hash objects

- app
- network
- splashscreen
- webView

I'm pretty sure that you can add your own Application configuration and access them from within your app somehow... please let me know ;)

### Cloud config

The `cloud.json` file contains the cloud application key and ID for your app.

### App layout

The `/app` folder contains:

- common
- drawer
- kitchensink
- navigation
- sensors
- status

The `/common` folder, contains a module that is injected (in common) for all other modules.
It thus can be viewed as a global module, containing global functionality.

For this example, it sets the allowed rotations for each module.

```coffee
angular
  .module 'common'
  .run (supersonic) ->
    supersonic.ui.screen.setAllowedRotations ["portrait", "portraitUpsideDown"]
```

Note that each main module, such as `drawer`, `kitchensink` and `navigation` act as stand-alone applications, each with their own webview which is pushed and popped on the stack.
Communication between these modules is done via events, by sharing common functionality and other such "tricks". This gives a nice decoupled multi-page architecture.

The `/kitchensink` folder is the main entry point of the app. Currently the `initialView` key in the `config/structure.coffee` is commented out, but otherwise it would start here and then go to `app/kitchensink/` which loads the `index.html` file there.

Let's enable the Initial view, since we would like to add Firebase Simple Login here.

### The Initial View

Let's edit `config/structure.coffee` and add `initialView` configuration:

```coffee
initialView:
  id: "initial-view"
  location: "kitchensink#initial"
```

Now we need to create a view: `/app/kitchensink/views/initial.html`

```html
<super-navbar>
  <super-navbar-title>
    Login
  </super-navbar-title>
</super-navbar>

<div class="padding" ng-controller="InitialController">

  <p>
  Mock log in button will dismiss the Initial View and initialize the app.
  </p>

  <button ng-click="login()" class="button button-block button-balanced">
    Log in
  </button>
</div>
```

Here we set the title of the native navigation bar to "Login". Then we configure the view to use the `InitialController` which we have yet to define. Finally we add some text and a button, with an Angular click handler that executes `login()` on the `InitialController`.

To follow the Steroids conventions, we create the `InitialController` controller in: `/app/kitchensink/scripts/InitialController.coffee`

```coffee
angular
.module('kitchensink')
.controller 'InitialController', ($scope, supersonic, $timeout) ->
  $scope.supersonic = supersonic

  $scope.login = ->
    console.log 'login'
    supersonic.logger.log 'logging in'
    supersonic.ui.initialView.dismiss()
```

### Debugging

When we add new features or change functionality, we need a place to debug and test. If you launch the simulator it is very difficult to debug, since you can only watch for log messages emitted.
If an exception or error occurs, or the logic is plain wrong and nothing happens, you can't really see why or what is going on... Therefore it is better to debug the app in a Browser before launching in a Simulator!

### Serving in the Browser

To serve (launch) the app in the browser, simply run:

`steroids connect --serve`

This will re-build the app... As the Connector is launched, you will see the following in the terminal:

`The server has now been started on port 4567`

Instead of launching a simulator from the terminal (which would just display a blank screen!)
Open a browser at `localhost:4567` or `0.0.0.0:4567`

This will display an identifier message for the app, such as:

```json
{
  "tinylr": "Welcome",
  "version": "0.1.4-AppGyver-p0"
}
```

To run and debug the initial view we just created, use the URL

`localhost:4567/app/kitchensink/initial.html`

This should display the Initial View in the browser. Now open your browser dev tools, such as *Chrome Dev Tools* on Chrome. Go to the console.
If you click on the Login button of the Initial View, you should see the log message in the console.
You will also notice that it tries to execute some API methods such as `dismissInitialView` which is only supported on a device and not in the browser. Hence nothing happens.
To circumvent this, we could perhaps create our own wrapper which uses the API if available and if not, simply redirects to a new page (in this case).

```bash
login
supersonic.logger.info: logging in
InitialView.dismiss called
WebBridge:  Object {method: "dismissInitialView", parameters: Object, callbacks: Object}
WebBridge: unsupported API method: dismissInitialView
```

Now that we can see that the functionality works as expected we can launch the app with `steroids connect`, then launch it in the simulator (or on a real device via QR Scanner) and see that the Mock login functionality works as expected!

Cool :)

### Build configuration

The *AppGyver Build Service*, part of *AppGyver Cloud* allows you to include custom Cordova plugins with your app. *To develop locally with these plugins*, you need to use the *Build Service* to *build a custom Scanner app* that you *download and install onto your device*.

First follow the instructions for building your app on iOS or Android and set up all the necessary files and settings for your app.

- [iOS build configuration](https://academy.appgyver.com/guides/27-ios-build-configuration)
- [Android build configuration](https://academy.appgyver.com/guides/53-android-build-configuration)

Then, in the Build Service's Configure iOS/Android Build Settings page for your app, find the Plugins field and include there an array of GitHub repos for the custom plugins you want to use, e.g.

Once you have added your custom plugins in the *Build Serviceâ€™s Configure iOS/Android Build Settings page*, these plugins will be included in all types of builds.

In addition to the Scanner builds, your custom plugins configured in the Build Service will be included in Ad Hoc builds and App Store/Google Play builds as well.

Steroids currently uses *Cordova 3.5.0*

[Default plugins included](https://academy.appgyver.com/categories/7-extending-with-plugins/contents/146-default-plugins)

The Build Service supports two tools for adding the plugin JavaScript files to your custom builds.

- plugman
- Cordova

You need to check the `plugin.xml` file for each plugin to see which method it uses.

The `<asset>` element just includes the plugin's JavaScript file in your app. The file won't show up in the project structure, but will be available on the device.
You need to *manually* include a `<script>` tag in your HTML to load the JavaScript file.

The `<js-module>` also injects the relevant <script> tag into the DOM of all WebViews. No manual step required :)

### Plugin for local development

The way to use custom plugins in local development is to *build a custom Scanner app* using the *AppGyver Cloud build service*.

You do need to set up the build config files as indicated in the Building your app for iOS/Building your app for Android guides, including the custom plugins you want to use.

When you request a Scanner build, you get a Scanner app that includes the custom plugins you need.

You can then develop locally with the regular Steroids workflow, and you only need to access the build service to build your .ipa/.apk once you're ready to release your app (or you want to change your plugins).

Please note that all plugins are configured solely via the Build Service.

See [Configuring custom PhoneGap plugins](https://academy.appgyver.com/guides/10-configuring-custom-phonegap-plugins)

The AppGyver Build Service lets you create an IPA package of your application that you can distribute either ad hoc or submit to the Apple App Store.

### Plugin repos

The [Oauth.io](https://oauth.io/) [plugin](https://github.com/oauth-io/oauth-phonegap) also looks interesting... Here is the [pricing mode](https://oauth.io/pricing)

They have a FREE Bootstrap Plan: 1000 monthly users, 2 Providers, 2 Apps. Enough to get started!

*Plugin registries*

- [Plugreg](http://plugreg.com/plugins)
- [Apache Cordova registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/#/)

Some useful cordova plugins:

- [email composer](https://github.com/AppGyver/email-composer/)
- [facebook](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin)
- [google+](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus)
- [twitter](http://plugreg.com/plugin/etiennea/phonegap-twitter-plugin)
- [social message](https://github.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-social-message)

WizCorp has loads of plugins which wrap native mobile APIs...

[Wizcorp plugins](https://github.com/Wizcorp?query=phonegap)

### AppGyver Addons

- [facebook addon](https://academy.appgyver.com/categories/16-steroids-addons/contents/134-facebook-addon-usage) wraps the Cordova facebook plugin with a simpler API

There are a few more which can be seen [here](https://github.com/AppGyver/addons-kitchensink)

## Cloud Deployment

See [Deploying your app to the cloud](https://academy.appgyver.com/guides/64-deploying-your-app-to-the-cloud)

`steroids deploy`

Steroids internally runs the steroids make and steroids package commands, which updates the contents of the `/dist` folder and creates a `.zip` package of your app.

Steroids then checks if there is a valid `config/cloud.json` file (JSON with the fields `id` and `hash`). If not, a new `config/cloud.json` file is created with a fresh app ID and hash.

When the file exists, Steroids uploads a new version of the app into the cloud, replacing the one previously deployed under that app ID.

## Android builds

Follow the [Android build configuration guide](https://academy.appgyver.com/guides/53-android-build-configuration) on how to create a `.keystore` file.

Use `android` as the password for the alias.

When you have the `.keystore` file, we can build your APK.

First, you need to create a cloud-deployed build of your app. You can do this with `$ steroids deploy` in your project folder. See the cloud deployment guide for more information.

Now go to `cloud.appgyver.com`, click on your app and then on the `Configure Build Settings` button.

- Upload your Android .keystore file, the one you just generated.
- Enter your keystore password.
- Enter your keystore alias.
- Enter your keystore alias password

### Custom Splash screens

Use the [Draw9Patch app](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/draw9patch.html) to design your custom Splash screen for Android
