Recently I have been applying for a few CTO and Lead developer positions, both in up-and-coming startups and in well-known, established corporations.

I have always strived for a leadership role in anything I do. As I get older I can see, that people feel my natural charisma and confidence and often let me have that leadership role automatically in whichever social group I am. It seems that most ppl are only too happy to give responsibility away to someone willing to take it.

Taking leadership is natural to me as I am first born of 3. I always had extemely high ambitions, striving to be the best I could be at everything I do... I always feel I can improve and do better, nevr quite satisfied, always hungry for more... my motto: "Learning is living"

I've had several leadership roles in past jobs and I have experiences many IT leaders (CTOs, project managers etc.) in various organizations, big and small.

In this post I will give my view point on what it takes to be a modern CTO and how this role has evolved over time and still evolving.... It is a world moving ever faster, where embracing tech and using it effectively is what drives any business to success or dooms it to failure!

### Working under a CTO

By far most CTOs I have worked under have been failures to my mind. They rarely had respect from their employees, as they didn't really concern themselves much with the day-to-day operations and concerns.

Most of them spent excessive time hiding in their office, or behind their screen (Excel sheets) and attended countless fruitless meetings going nowhere. They took high level decisions without sufficient knowledge of the consequences, because of lack of technical insight ("Let's just choose a product from the 4th quadrant of this recent Gartner report.").

Why is it still so dismal out there? Is it about to change or already changing?

### The Old school

*"There is nothing like the old school and I'm the fucking head master!!!"* - Rock'n Rolla

The old school CTO role is more of a "classic" leadership role. The IT world used to be much more stable and predictable. You could plan ahead with reasonable confidence. There were often few options to choose from, mostly a choice between a few well-established products, system suites, development platforms etc.
In order for better integration between products in a full system suite, the strategic decision would often involve choosing one product suite or the other.

Most CTOs would have to make choices between:

- Oracle vs Microsoft SQL Database
- Oracle middleware suite vs. BEA, vs IBM vs Microsoft
- Java or .NET enterprise development platform
- ...

The school world allowed for CTOs how were mainly business oriented and who didn't have to concern themselves much with the underlying technologies. This type of CTO would often have a lead developer/chief architect who managed the more technical day-to-day aspects and concerns of the team.

This type of CTO often had more of a business background and had just learned enough IT buzzwords and concepts to manage the IT strategy of a company:

- read Gartner reports and "go with the flow"
- take the recommended enterprise path with dedicated support contracts, patches and upgrades
- never take any risk beyond business-as-usual

It used to be very costly to run an IT department. You had to:

- Buy your own servers
- Have server experts on site to maintain/configure servers

- Licenses:  
  - Development platform
  - Databases
  - Server applications

- Development
  - In-house developers
  - Licensed development software (Editors and IDEs)
  - Licensed Office software  

- Sales personel  
- Marketing personel
- IT support

A lot to manage, but mainly centered around having/maintaining:

- personel to feel key specialist roles
- software licenses
- hardware

This kind of world is very much like a classic factory/production system, where the company has all the personel and machinery in order to run daily operations and produce. It is a simple system and pretty easy to get an overview. A company can be made to run smoothly over long periods without big changes or surprises.

### A changing landscape

During the last decade, from around 2004 to the present (2014) there has been a huge shift in the software and hardware industries. The power of the Internet has enabled
radically new business models. A huge driver has been the exponential rise in computing power for ever lower cost (Moore's Law).

It started to make sense for a business to to have service providers provide servers, databases and server apps for a low service fee. The scale they need at the time they need it. "Just in time delivery".

Business models that had recently only been within the reach of huge corporations were now in the reach of small firms, even startups. You could host your app on a hosting provider with all your server needs managed for you at almost no cost and have the whole world as your marketplace!

No reason to:
- buy expensive Microsoft Office software when you had free/online alternatives.
- use enterprise development platforms such as .NET or JavaEE, when you could use a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL PHP - how Facebook was built!)

The entry barrier to compete was going ever lower and the competition increased. The small were suddenly in a position to challenge the big established firms, who were slow to turn around their huge supertankers in a rapidly changing world. "Small is smart!"

Open source (OS) software such as as Linux and Git were getting ever more popular, especially with smaller firms on a tight budget. Online versioning systems such as Git made it easy to share and distribute software development across the whole world, which made for easy out-sourcing. Developer wages were under pressure and going down as well...

Online repo providers such as Github made it possible to easily share and find OS software to fill your need. OS communities started to form and spring up everywhere... Professional OS libraries quickly grew from a few dozen to hundreds and soon many 1000s and more.

There were free alternatives to any kind of software. Everything was getting ever cheaper and within reach of everyone.

- Free Databases
- Free Office app alternatives
- Free IDEs and editors
- Free Operating System upgrades
- Free libraries, frameworks, ...

- Online sales via e-commerce
- Online marketing via social media

- Low cost
  - Outsourced developers
  - Outsourced HR, Sales, Marketing
  - Application hosting
  - Continous Integration (CI) testing

This all lead to a radically different world in which to make decisions and envision a strategy. Agile development was taking over from the old Waterfall approach. The Waterfall project model was inherited from Engineering projects, who also operate in a more stable world where projects can be planned in details years in advance.

The problem with the Waterfall model was becoming ever more apparent as huge enterprise/government projects failed ever more consistently. There were simply too many unknowns in any project to plan ahead and make budget estimates. By the time a huge project was nearing the finish line, it was often seen as a failure. In many cases it had already obsolete, either from a technical perspective or due to outside forces, such that lighter alternatives had already taken its place.

It was slowly dawning, that a project had to be sufficiently small that it could be managed effectively and designed in such a way that it was flexible to change. Managers and Developers now had to have an "Agile" mindset, and continually ask themselves what was the best way to proceed given the circumstances, rather than just "sticking to plan" and run into a blind alley.

### Changing CTO roles?

We can see that the world of IT has changed significantly during the past decade. Has the role of the CTO kept pace with these development?

The answer in my experience is pretty mixed.

### Large corporations

Many large corporations/organizations still have a very old school way of operating and looking at the world. There are several reasons for this:

- leaders (mostly) advance due to seniority and not ability

When taking risk
- there is a high price for failure
- there is little reward for success

This means that to advance as a leader, you will likely stay very conservative. The corporation will (hopefully) still survive under your leadership, simply due to the advantage of being a big fish.

However, several high-profile companies have suffered severely or gone completely out of business, from being too conservative with respect to their IT strategy. Well known names such as: Nokia, Microsoft, Yahoo, HP, ... come to mind.

Other big names have taken a radically different approach, leveraging this new world. Instagram is run by a team of only 4 developers. The twitter dev team is less than 20 ppl to my knowledge.

So there is no reason why being a large corporations, requires you to have huge projects and large dev teams with all the complexity (and inherent risk) that involves. The new "gold standard" is to be as small and agile as you can get away with while still delivering.


### The New school

A new school of CTOs are coming to the fore-front in this new multi-faceted IT world full of possibilities and hence choices to make at all levels.

To fully take advantage of all the new possibilities, you need someone with a sufficient technical mindset and understanding to both see the big picture and create a strategy, while understanding each component on its own and how it relates to other components from various different perspectives:

- architecture
- maintainability
- stability
- costs
- ...

The CTO needs to balance out all these factors and create a production pipeline, consisting of  architecture and infrastructure that is flexible to change as the future and tech landscape evolves...

This is a much harder problem to tackle, and not suited for a business oriented CTO to deal with.
Which is why the most successful IT firms today, have replaced business CTOs and even CEOs with engineers.

[Why  engineers make great CEOs](http://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/why-engineers-make-great-ceos-3318)

"They’re detail-oriented, analytical and trained in systematic problem-solving. Engineers’ basic qualities make them good candidates for the top."

"Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, is an engineer. So is General Motors’ Mary Barra and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos; and the list goes on. In fact, engineering has long been ranked as the most common undergraduate degree among Fortune 500 CEOs.""

Engineers are trained to be analytical systems thinkers. They can have both a holistics view of the system while still considering the details. They can manage complex by reducing it to components that interact and understand how to continually simplify the overall system design to improve it.
We live in a world with ever more complex systems, interactions and products. It is only natural that engineering skills are becoming ever more important to run a business well.

Even companies such as Wallmart, are going down this road and now have a small dedicated engineering team which [leverages Node.js](http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/24/why-walmart-is-using-node-js/) to drastically increase: performance, productivity and quality, while reducing costs and time to market.

“We rely on services all over the world,” Almaer continued “We do not control all of those services. Node allows us to front all these services… and scale up very nicely. It’s perfect for what we’re doing in mobile.”

Walmart has fully embraced the new reality, and ever more companies will follow suite in the coming years or risk dying out like another Dinosaur. The nimble "mammalians" are taking over ;)

### The good

A good CTO is one who:

- Understands overall business strategy
- Thinks system design/architecture
- Has strategic vision
  - for the present
  - for the future, taking advantage of new options down the road
- Ensure his staff
  - are productive
  - deliver quality product (testing + code reviews)
  - have a good infrastructure
  - have good tools to work with
  - have guidelines or how to best deliver

- Understands and considers the "tech landscape"
- Thinks of new ways to improve the "pipeline"

A good CTO must be someone who follows the Toyota motto of always trying to optimize the production process with respect to: productivity, quality and cost.

He must also be good at communicating with:
- employees, boosting morale
- heads of other departments
- external vendors, partners etc.

A modern CTO should always consider how to improve operations, such as through out-sourcing what isn't "core business". Components that can be considered plug-ins or external to the core engine should be out-sourced to the degree it makes sense. However any out-sourcing involves careful day-to-day management or it will quickly get out of hand. All core business development should be done in-house, but with the flexibility that employees are free to work where and when they like as long as they deliver within what is expected.

A good CTO should be deeply involved with trying to find new tools, platforms, libraries and technologies that can be used to boost productivity further, increase quality or lower cost significantly. Often these metrics are very much interlinked. Higher quality will cause reduced costs (less bug fixing). Lower costs will mean less complexity and thus higher productivity etc.

A key aspect to consider is technical debt. That is, what might be cheaper/faster and more productive in the very short run can have dramatic costs down the line. Projects often die due to technical debt.
A quick prototype is hacked on by a few developers and ends up forming the core of the final product.
Whenever new features are to be added, the core is such a mess, that to add the functionality withintight deadlines it ends up adding more mess and eventually no-one can figure out the internals of the system and it becomes a "Pandora's box" that almost no-one dares to touch. Any experienced developer has seen this story play out time and again, especially where there is no testing or code reviews in place as part of the process (as it adds more time/cost) and not seen to benefit.
The CTO must ensure this doesn't happen!

### The bad

In my experience, a "bad" modern CTO is someone who is not involved in the day-to-day operations of his developent department. It have encountered this surprisingly often, especially at large orgnizations of more than 50 ppl, where the CTO often seem to consider himself too important to deal with such technical details, preferring instead to focus on budget estimates and meetings with other heads of division. Another reason could be, that often these CTOs have left their tech background/knowledge behind and don't want to have their lack of knowledge exposed too openly.

Such CTOs are fooling themselves to think they can hide their lack of knowledge and they quickly loose respect from their employees.

Often such CTOs minimize contact with their employees, down to the extent of 1hr weekly meetings or less (in my experience). They just "hope for the best" and keep out of the way, in order to not cause friction. When they do get involved, they have little clue what is going on and just burst out generalisations like: "We have to finish by this dead-line..." not willing to admit that the project has been greatly underestimated (often for "political" or economic motives) or not given sufficient resources and thus the real blame is on the CTO and not the team.

### The ugly?

The "ugly" CTO is someone with a deep tech background who micro-manages everything at the tech level as if he was still a developer. He needs to learn to delegate such details to his employees and trust them, but still have an opinion and discuss technical matters.

The ugly CTO is introvert and not a good communicator. He might have respect from his team from a purely technical perspective, but he lacks the management skills to make them operate as an effective team, and quickly they become divided into kings and peasants and various groups who don't work effectively together, either in tech terms or the personal level.

The ugly CTO could also be a business manager who thinks he can fulfill a CTO role with a few cool IT/management buzzwords and "telling those NERDS what to do". However he doesn't really know what he is doing/sayin and just causes anger, frustration and other bad vibes with his employee who understand he is sending them down some wrong paths but is too high-headed to listen to critique from the "stupid little nerds" he is managing...  

### PKIs

Some of the main [KPIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) to target for a modern CTO:

- Developer productivity
- Code quality/bugs
- Technical debt
- Test coverage (unit, integration + acceptance)
- Infrastructure & Tools
  - simplicity
  - flexibility
- Total costs (time/money)
- Time to deliver new/changed feature
- Time to deliver product
- Time to change/substitute system component

### Conclusion

This analysis and discussion should give a pretty clear overview of how I see the CTO role from a modern perspective, how it has been and has evolved and the tech landscape has radically changed and is forever changing as we move forward.

The CTO role is becoming an ever more complex role to fill as everything around him is happening so fast and there are so many concerns to think about at the same time and evaluate their consequences at a holistic level. This is why a modern CTO needs to have a deep engineering background/experience and understanding, while still being a good communicator, and able to think and make decisions on a broad systemic level. A good CTO must strive to make his team as productive as they can be, and likely have them follow several parallel paths, completing current projects with one set of tools & techs while phasing in new tools & tech in experimental/side-line projects that are not affecting the core.

It is super hard to be a good modern CTO. A key feature is to not give into pressure and feel overburdened by stress and information overload but have a sufficient overview and delegate tasks to the team so he can keep calm even in stressful situations and still joke around and make the workplace a great place to be for everyone.

Not an easy task, but I believe I'm up to the challenge!!! :)

### Learning from mistakes...

Sure, I've made mistakes. The best way to learn is making your own mistakes, 2nd best is to observe others make mistakes. 3rd is to see someone do it successfully...

I used to be more of a "hacker", meaning that I would try to get a working solution as quickly/easily as possible. I was often awarded for this approach, as this is what you are paid for as a consultant or hired for as a developer. To deliver features quickly!

However, as I got more experience as a developer and other roles related to systems development and started reading about Clean Code, architecture practices, Design and Anti-patterns etc. I started to be more careful in how I would write or design a system, trying to adhere to best practices.
This approach has some cost "here and now" but leads to less technical debt down the road, which from experience I had come to detest and learned how to avoid... but I started realizing, that the higher level of quality would cost me. Management preferred hackers over clean coders, there was only one KPI - delivering quickly and move on.

When I was CTO in my first startups I wanted to follow my heart and design/architecture philosophy and design and good app from the ground up.

The goal was to build an app using flexible components and infrastructure, which made for easier change down the roads if we changed our minds... With a small team and tight deadlines/budget you don't have time to make costly mistakes! When you design an app from scratch you discover all kinds of things down the road you didn't think of and then you need to change various parts. So unless you designed the system up fron to be flexible for change you end up paying an every higher price down the road or end up being "locked in" in your own app!

So I followed this strategy with vigilance, doing Test Driven development and "the works", but due to unrealistic deadlines and little tech backing/support it ended up leading to conflicts with the more business oriented managers who just wanted "features delivered" without regard of the consequences.
I tried to explain my position, drawing parallels to building a house or a car, explaining that it is all the infrastructure/plumbing inside that you don't see which is the main part of the building process. But naturally they wanted "pixels on the screen", to show off to investors, family, friends etc.

I had the backing of my dev team who fully understood and respected this perspective but conflicts with  business who had to meet tight deadlines with investors to get the next pool of money or go broke.
At the time I didn't fully understand this game, and so I learned... You have to strike a compromise and build the minimally viable product AQAP to get investor money and then you can start all over again... (hopefully!)

Recently I've read in engineering newspapers and the like that a similar story has been playing out in various innovation based businesses, from alternative energy to medical and IT - all suffer from not having suficient time/money to create a viable product that can compete in the market. They are forced to deliver buggy, sub-par solutions in order to meet their targets, ending up costing them everything in the end anyways...

So there really is no easy/good solution to this dilemma, except sufficient experience/understanding of the "game" and hopefully enough time/money to pull through. However an other problem could be to have too much time/money which can lead to over-engineering the app and never finish anything.

It is a fine balance indeed - why so many projects fail. It has taken me a loooong time to fully appreciate this fact and understand the traps built in to this process and all he concerns involved!!

So yes, I've made my fair share of mistakes and no-one is perfect or if they believe to be, they must be fools! I still have much to learn and mistakes to makes... such is life! But at least I try to learn from my mistakes and consider more viewpoints whenever I make decisions than before when I was more "proud" and sure of myself that "my way" was he only viable way! It is much more complicated!!

In the end it is all about resources, spririt, team work and "travelling light". Why I hate bloated system designs... KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid! So true! This is key.

- "Genious is to make the complicated simple"
- "Good design is when there is no more to take away"
