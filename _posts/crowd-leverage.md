"Hackers paradise"

Ie. building off-grid, sustainable communities for creative people, to escape the matrix and contribute to develop new solutions for a better world…

3D printing, apps, documentary films, books, art, permaculture, earthships, hydroponics, aquaponics … Creating a 21st century physical/virtual society ;)

[Crowd funding sites](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/crowdfunding-sites/)

- Donation model (gofundme or Facebook causes)
- Pre-order model (kickstarter) Pre-buy product for later delivery
- Reward based model (indiegogo) - satisfaction of helping, immediate reward
- Equity model (dividends)

You need to get first 20-40%, then people will jump on board (ie. critical mass)

Kickstarter is only for the US.

Update videos, fx, one every 10 days for 40 day campaign!

[47daycrowdfunder](http://www.47daycrowdfunder.com)

Average campaign, only $5.500. Keep your Raise low, better to go much above target! People want to identify with winners!

Family and friends should typically contribute 20%.

Synchronize media outes/appearances/articles,blogs with campaign.
Especially at the beginning.

[Keys to Crowd Funding Success - IndieGogo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r4uFiNtdL4)

- Have a pitch video
- Offer 3 or more perks (5-7)
- Update every few days
- Post media to your gallery
- Link to other pages (blogs etc)
- Campaign less than 2 months (30-50 days)

Be VERY honest and transparent!!
Quality over Quantity - get real connection.
Grow community support even before campaign, then use as contact list. Make the feel special as early supporters, encourage them to spread the word and be evangelists!
Find Blogs etc. who will make a post about your project!

We invite musicians to come join. We should promote community members to play/listen to community produced music, enjoy local arts, food etc.

Find interest groups (targeted audience), discover what triggers them. How can we win them over?

We could make several simultaneous campaigns. Use some of community campaign money as capital to develop first apps to get them to market.

You need to be able to deliver maximum 6-12 months after campaign starts or ppl will lose interest.

Make the story, project personal and emotional. Get emotional connect and for people to indentify with you, that they have the same dreams, longing etc. Should be part of video.

Get a number of friends etc. to do the Crowdfunding marketing on a commission basis (reward).
95 to 99% are lurkers/followers, only 1-5% will commit to your project.

See Crowdfunding more as a Community building platform, the funding/money is just an added bonus if people feel part of the community. They will even spread the word and evangelize for you!
Ask other people how they would do it. Use social platforms, networking!
People love to be part of something they really care about. Too little of that in Industrial society model. There is a hunger for change and possibility to be part of something great!

We need to collaborate with others who are doing similar things, such as Earthship movement, Transition Towns etc. and mention them.

Think carefully about incentives!

### Planning

## Science of persuasion

[Science of persuasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFdCzN7RYbw)

Scientific principles of persuasion

- Reciprocity:
- Scarcity
- Authority
- Consistency
- Liking
- Consensus

### Reciprocity

Obligation to give when you receive
Be the first to give, make it personalized and unexpected!

### Scarcity

People want more of what there is less of.

Benefits, what is Unique and what they stand to Lose if they don't buy into it.

### Authority

People will follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts
Better to have other people voucher for you, than to do your own marketing.
Mention credentials!

### Consistency

Looking for and asking for commitments that can be made.
Voluntary, active, public commitments. Get them to make the first small step and follow through with more... Involve people.

### Liking

- People who are similar
- People who give us compliments
- People who cooperate with us to achieve goals

Share information, background etc. Make for cozy atmosphere, less stress, more trust.

### Consensus

When unsure, people will look to the actions of others to determine their own.
