We live in paradoxical times. We are quickly transitioning from a mainly Industrial economy into an information and now networking/social economy and onwards. The basic society infrastructure, such as the main instituions of politics, work and education and (mostly) unable and unwilling to change significantly to reflect the changing society, unless they are forced to, which often means it is too late to change (think all the media industries).

This buil-in resistance is due to their monopoly status and the fact that they are top down, hierarchical structures, where the people in power are from the old generation and want to maintain their power structure at all costs. It can be summed up as "the psychology of previous investment".

For employers and employees the current crisis is due to new and changing requirements, which the employer and even more so, most employees have simply not been "designed" for. We are often not as flexible as we think.

The world is becoming ever more mobile and networked, which means that your physical location is becoming much less of a factor. Everything is becoming networked and "virtual". In the future, we might distribute the designer blue prints and print on location (via 3D printers) instead of shipping products around, much like what the IT revolution meant for information products.

In this environment, the companies use the globalised world to have a distributed workforce across the world (most value for money), meaning ever more wage pressure and competition - a "race to the bottom". This in turn leads to ever increasing deflation in a vicious circle!

Since companies are no longer situated in any particular country but use the tax laws of various countries to their advantage, it means a global competition on company tax rates in a desperate attempt to attract and keep them.

The top employees may soon see the same dynamics play out, where countries compete to attract them with lower tax rates and more benefits, in order to attract their talent and job growth potential, such as competing for entrepreneurs - see f.ex [Chile startup scene](http://www.startupchile.org/).

Since everything is being sped up, it also means that companies need to be ever more flexible to the demands of the market and new technologies. They mostly hire people on a "per need" basis, temporary contract or consultants for individual projects. Employees are expected to come in, get up to speed in no time, be productive for a short while, and then leave for other projects in the same organization or elsewhere where their current skills still have value. On top they are expected to take care of their own education and staying up to speed with the latest developments in their "free time".

This could mean the end to citizenship for the top tier of professionals, who can take advantage of these development much like professional sports players, having the top sports clubs bid for them.
In new survivor class is being bred, known as the "New Rich" such as described by Tim Ferris in [The four hour work week](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/). These characters can take advantage of this environment and have an amazing de-coupled lifestyle, but it is has downsides as well (no long term bonding).

The new environment requires flexibility, the ability to learn as you go, a very creative mindset and great social/networking skills, exactly those skills which the current school system is designed to destroy, see [The purpose of School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEWPbTad_Q). These are the anti-skills of the industrial system for which the school system is designed, where human resources are requires to be obedient worker drones doing mostly monotonous tasks and not asking questions or thinking too much.

This means that most students are actually destroying their core required skills by staying in school. Yet companies are also still "old school" and require a diploma as a basic filtering mechanism.

Thus there are very candidates who manage to take an education and still maintain those critical creative skills. Those few inherently understand they are a special breed and they don't have patience for rigid corporate structures... which makes these candidates hard to fit in at most enterprises...
These creative spirits mostly wanna go their own way and avoid having a boss commanding them around.
Companies are beginning to realise that it is increasingly difficult to attract these talents which are in ever higher demand. The workplace needs to transform into a creative, social hub and away from rigid hierarchies and unproductive, slow standardised/conformist processes typical of the industrial age

The huge remainder of employees are becoming the new underclass of obsolete workers who are being replaced by automation since most of the skills they have been taught in school are easy to automate or outsource to a large extent. This is the problem with using a "one size fits all" education template.

The predictable result is a bankrupt economy with a few winners (agile countries, companies and employees) while most countries, companies, and employees lose out. In this kind of "economy" it becomes increasingly difficult to have any kind of normal family life as it is impossible to plan ahead . The present is changing too fast and the future is ever more unpredictable.

In a deflationary economy with ever more of the tax burden on the "common man", most people feel unable to save for pension. On top in a work environment with no job security except for minimal (and decreasing) state benefits and ever increasing demands on skills, time, mobility etc., most young people feel unable to settle down and have a family.

This insecurity leads to much less family formation, which leads to declining birth rates and a [Demographic Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZeyYIsGdAA). The insecurity and external pressure leads to [depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvshNZhaIn4), escapism (games, sex, consumerism, ...), suicides and so on. The youth, especially men are [opting out](http://thefederalist.com/2013/12/20/men-irrational-opting-education-careers-families/) in increasing numbers as they see no future or role in society. In Japan this is a real epidemic known as the [Herbivoore Men](http://www.avoiceformen.com/sexual-politics/m-g-t-o-w/a-real-study-of-japanese-herbivore-men/)

We have seen this gaining ever more momentum in the past few decades since globalisation and IT started making its mark in societies across the globe. We are all becoming fragmented with less community and support, everyone expected to survive on his or her own. The Baby boomer generation puts all the pressure on their children, expecting them to do better than them, just like they did, not realising how much times have changed... we are on a depression trajectory which needs to bottom out before it can get better, which could take several generations!

This development still has a long to go, unless it is interrupted by external factors (peak oil,
climate change, economic collapse, global pandemic or other major societal "shakers and breakers").

We have collectively decided that profits, GDP and technological progress are the main indicators of our collective success as a society, but is that really so?
Any sane (non-economical) creature would by nature take happiness, time, love, care and family as the main indicators of individual and collective success. If we keep going off this cliff we are destined to fall very far indeed until we rediscover our true humanity and abolish all these stupid notions that the economy is the only game in town.

We are playing a giant game of Monopoly and predictable most end up losers with a few winners at the top, who can leverage ever more of their power to canibalize on the system and leave nothing for the masses. In the end such a system must and will break down. It is only a matter of time.

Happy hunting ;)
