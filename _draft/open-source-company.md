*What do you want to do when you grow up?* A classic questions asked to kids as they are growing up.

I clearly recall many things while growing up. I was super creative, spend loads of time designing my own and playing games with my closest mates. Eventually we settled on Dungeons & Dragons, a super creative game where you envision, design and act in a make believe fantasy world.

### Schooling and "Education"

In contrast schools are designed to "break" the children, make them conform and obey to authority and deliver stupid assignments and homework as required by the supervisor (teacher) in order to receive the reward (good grade). [The purpose of school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEWPbTad_Q) by John Taylor Gatto.

"I've noticed a fascinating phenomenon in my twenty-five years of teaching - that schools and schooling are increasingly irrelevant to the great enterprises of the planet.
No one believes anymore that scientists are trained in science classes or politicians in civics classes or poets in English classes. The truth is that schools don't really teach anything except how to obey orders." - John Taylor Gatto

The education system, like every other institution of our current society reflects the factory system. Mandatory public schooling was instituted in the mid 19th century in order to train the working class children to be productive factory workers, clerks etc. The early factories did not need workers to have any creativity. It was better if you could have the workers shut their mind off and stand all day doing mindless, repetitive tasks, modelled on [Taylorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) , specialized down to a few body movements all day long like a machine.... The school was thus designed specifically to [dumb down and kill creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY) as Sir Ken Robinson vividly describes.

Gradually there was a demand for workers with more advanced skills and education was extended to high school and eventually college to *deliver* scientists, engineers, lawyers, doctors and government bureaucrats. We have come a long way since then, and today most parents aspire their kids to take a college degree to ensure their prospects in society. If only it was so...

### Globalization and Tech

We have now however come to the point where technology and globalisation have led to the outsourcing and automation of most production and low/medium skilled knowledge/service work.

This had in turn led to the "race to the bottom", where companies chase the cheapest working force around the world to stay competitive, which means that workers no longer have any wage power but must take what they are offered. This is aggravated even further with so called "free trade" agreements, where governments agree to atrocious living standards and environmental degradation for their constituents in return for a few jobs in multi-national corporations.

The natural outcome has been a spiral of global competition and education inflation as everyone tries desperately to escape this poverty trap, but as there are more and more people globally all chasing the same few middleclass service/knowledge jobs, most end up as losers.

Technology has been advancing at break-neck speed, exponentially accelerating change. Society, politicians and the legal system have been caught completely off-guard, not able to adapt to a radically changing system.

### Lost generations

Young people growing up today react as you would expect. Some see this picture clearly and feel depressed and hopeless about their future. Increasing numbers are checking out.
Others live in a fantasy world of commercials and consumption, trying to compete with their peers in popularity contests, with tattoos, bodies, fake boobs and social media posts, getting ever more detached from personal/emotional human contact.

Not surprisingly, there has been a massive increase in mental problems, depression, suicide etc. from people born into this dehumanising system. Psychologist know that we humans have some basic human/emotional needs and these are simply not being met in this fast paced, highly competitive, predatory capitalist dog-eat-dog world we now live in.

The fallout from this can be seen clearly in the statistics, including a severe [Demographic Winter - the new economic reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8XQjfG2wYc), . As young people have lost hope/faith in the system and their future, they have no desire (and feel unable financially) to have kids.

### Elite oppression

Many people want change, but those in power are not about to give up their system and have spent decades ensuring they have a firm grip, using: politics, the legal system and the ever more brutal police to squash any dissent.

It is with all this in mind that ever more people are trying to find ways to break out of this vicious system which eats everything in its path (nature, people etc). Looks like "the machines" (legal fictions - ie. corporations) have taken over and consume everything in the name of profits, see movie - [The Corporation : The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6zQO7JytzQ)

### A new path

My previous post [The Revolution is here](http://infomatrix-blog.herokuapp.com/post/the-revolution-is-here) described how many of the recent tech developments are finally maturing to the state where they are ready to facilitate a new social (society) revolution to benefit and empower us all.

I firmly believe that most "young" people would gladly give up their current position in school or at work to help build these systems to transform society, even for little or no pay beyond the most basic needs.

What if we created a new collaborative model, based on the Open Source software movement, where people come together and help each other build such systems and collaborative communities, virtual, real or a combination.

### Funding and engagement

We now have plenty of ways to fund and kickstart such progressive/social movements:

- crowd funding such as [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com)
- [crowd sourcing](http://www.crowdsourcing.org/) such as [Bounty Source](https://www.bountysource.com/)
- digital currencies
- ...

People are more willing to sponsor and contribute to campaigns for positive societal change, than "just another consumer product to make the founders rich".

Not surprisingly, it turns out that people are much more motivated to contribute and be part of some worthwhile, meaningful project than to work for scraps in order to make someone else rich.
If you are part of something you believe in, you will be highly motivated and willing to sacrifice both time and money. This is why there is ever more young people signing up for NGO projects.

The crowd sourcing model could be used to create democratic organisations without traditional leadership, where people come together to work on projects/applications/products to make for a better future.

This model could be crowd funded and the products/apps given freely to the sponsors in return.
It could likely still earn enough revenue to supply the basic needs for participants/developers and any surplus could be funnelled into new projects such as buying 3D printers and labs, organic hydroponic farms and building off the grid housing such as earth-ships for community participants to live in.

In short order this could become a huge movement, similar to [Transition Towns](http://www.transitionnetwork.org/) or they could be combined.

### Collaborative

It looks impossible to reform the current system "from the inside", until it completely collapses and breaks down. The only way is to break completely free and start a new society outside, but within the bounds of the current one. When faced with enough desperation within the current system people will flee to whatever alternative seems promising and workable. We could finally be in position to offer a real alternative :)

The main focus points of such an organization:
- Education - free self-exploration, group learning, mentoring, work shops
- Food - [Permaculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture), [Hydroponics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics), [Aquaponics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics)
- Social (fireside chat, stories, music, dance, art, nature)

If such a society could get enough starting income to setup renewable food/energy systems and basic dwellings we are a long way. Then extra income could come from selling surplus food and developing solutions to help society transition.

### Develop and teach

- Medical apps (better exchange/transparency of medical data)
- Education apps (enable self-learning and creativity)
- Digital currency payment systems
- Enable more blogs on transition and alternative living
- Sharing, caring and barter economy apps
- ...

We should mentor/teach community members to learn the skills needed to help build such systems.
They should also help with permaculture, building/construction etc. to get a balanced life.
We can harvest a lot of the building materials from the environment, such as waste - as exemplified by Earthships which recycles tires, bottles, metalic frames etc.

The vision is to create physical communities built on this model in some places which offer good year-round conditions. We could take advantage of the fact that land is cheap and the climate "generous" in several Southern european countries, parts of South eastern Asia and South/Central America etc.

Funding could be done on a reward basis:
- low (stay in community a weekend/week)
- medium (get one product for free)
- high (community member + get one product for free)

Another type of funding would be to invite directly to workshops for a small fee, to get the community experience and learn new skills. Many young people are willing to pay for this privilige to discover/learn new things about themselves and feel they contribute to something positive and have a great social experience as well, outside "the matrix".
